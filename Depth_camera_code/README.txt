This is a repository to hold the code for my experiments around the Intel Realsense D435i depth camera and counting people walking through a threshold.
This code and environment had to be created from within a Linux environment due to the improved support and quality for the Intel Realsense SDK, compared to the Windows version.

This code provides a solution to counting and tracking people in an enclosed space without the use of any artificial intelligence. Instead, it makes use of a depth camera and various algorithms.

### TODO ###

Look at how i can improve the detection quality and reduce drop outs
